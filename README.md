# MyPowerPlan
-I made this batch script file to choose faster between my power plans. 
--âœ¨ If you want to use it, you need to do some changese as for that:
    ---1. Open .bat file in any text editor;
    ---2. Modify Power Scheme GUID (e.g. POWERCFG /s 381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e);
        //Because you might have a different GUID than mines I have.
        //To see yours GUITD use "POWERCFG /list" in CMD.
