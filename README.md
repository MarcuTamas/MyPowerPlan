# MyPowerPlan
I made this batch script file to choose faster between my power plans, because I have noticed that my laptop's overall performance will improve if I choose a different power plan than the balance, of course, despite the battery fast drain.

✨ If you want to use it, you need to do some changes as for that:
1. Open the .bat file in any text editor;
2. ***⚠️ Modify Power Scheme GUID for each power plan configuration (e.g. POWERCFG /s 381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e);***
	- **Because you might have a different GUID for powerplans than the ones I have.**
		- *To see your GUITD use the "POWERCFG /list" command in CMD.*
		- *To add a new power plan search on the internet.*
	
3. Save it and put the bat file anywhere fits (e.g. on Desktop) or make a shortcut.
